Base dotfiles for my default arch linux setup. "programs.csv" contains a list of packages that these dotfiles reference. Those packages and these dotfiles can be deployed with [LARBS](https://github.com/opmorgan/larbs).

These dotfiles can also be deployed with stow. To do so, clone this repo to your home directory, then [use stow to symlink config files to their target locations.](http://brandon.invergo.net/news/2012-05-26-using-gnu-stow-to-manage-your-dotfiles.html)
