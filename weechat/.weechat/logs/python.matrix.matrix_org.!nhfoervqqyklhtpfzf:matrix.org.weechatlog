2020-06-23 22:23:48	zarathustra_69	ok finally on this shit
2020-06-23 22:24:05	zarathustra_69	fyckerz!!
2020-06-23 22:24:48	zarathustra_69	anybody know how the FUCk to get qutebrowser dark mode working?
2020-06-23 22:25:12	zarathustra_69	I have enabled it via the :set command... doesn't seem to work
2020-06-23 22:25:42	zarathustra_69	i usually use the "dark reader" browser extension on firefox
2020-06-24 09:06:01	&ttylta	I'll look into it today.
2020-06-24 09:14:14	&ttylta	Did this work for you zarathustra_69: config.set("colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled", True)
2020-06-24 09:39:55	zzarathustra_69	Yes, well, I did it from the command prompt, and also thru the config page. Is that syntax u sent meant to be in a config file tho?
2020-06-24 09:41:06	zzarathustra_69	P.S., finally using my linux workstation for werk B-)... it is worth it just to use i3, rather than fumbling around with Windows
2020-06-24 09:41:35	zzarathustra_69	I've just been lazy/busy, but its vacation season so things get slow.
2020-06-24 09:48:52	&ttylta	SWEEEEEEEEET
2020-06-24 09:49:02	&ttylta	And yeah, that should go in .config/qutebrowser/config.py
2020-06-24 09:53:03	zzarathustra_69	I see, I'll try that. Weird it's not working the other ways, as it's supposed to.
2020-06-24 10:01:25	zzarathustra_69	Yeah still not working!
2020-06-24 10:07:11	&ttylta	huh
2020-06-24 10:07:19	&ttylta	I'll keep trying things on my end and report back
2020-06-24 10:07:34	&ttylta	What are you expecting it to do btw?
2020-06-24 10:11:02	zzarathustra_69	Well, on websites like archlinux.org, I am expecting it to enable dark mode so that the website shows a dark color scheme instead of the basic white background
2020-06-24 10:12:33	zzarathustra_69	But, it could be that this website doesn't have a true dark mode. The FF/Chrome extension I use, "Dark Reader", just inserts come code when it loads a web page, so it could create the illusion for me that more websites have a dark theme than really do
2020-06-24 10:13:41	zzarathustra_69	But it's description says that it enables the websites dark theme, so I figured qute would work the same. But its possible that the qutebrowser way is weaker.
2020-06-24 21:45:09	zarathustra_69	well, for some reason it finally started working... maybe because i finally closed all instances of qutebrowser... hadn't thought of that
2020-06-26 08:24:34	zzarathustra_69	well, I'll be hangin and hackin tonight if anybody wants to
2020-06-26 18:17:51	zarathustra_69	jjjjj

2020-06-18 18:43:34	zzarathustra_69	some day covid will not prevent us from travel and we can get together for a weekend and eat pizza and drink soda pop!
2020-06-18 18:42:13	zzarathustra_69	pre-covid i was hoping to come up to bmore to do so in person, and now y'all are movin away! but we can always do it virtual.
2020-06-18 18:41:29	zzarathustra_69	that'd be down the line tho when we are comfortable with the syntax and stuff... but would be cool to do from time to time if we want a little boost, only so much we will ever get done together in a few hours a week
2020-06-18 18:40:24	zzarathustra_69	I'd also be into, once we get working on a project down the line, doing something like a whole-day ojjo marathon where we do a bunch of work
2020-06-18 18:39:46	zzarathustra_69	but I was thinking we could look at 'c programming language' and talk about a general plan or way of going about working thru it
2020-06-18 18:39:02	zzarathustra_69	im still doin some ricing stuff, really just need to get the terminal font bigger and I cant remember how I did that on this one

2020-07-02 18:28:11	ommira	also, has anyone tried the problems on https://projecteuler.net/? I'm thinking of working through some of them in C as a way to get comfy
2020-07-02 18:25:49	ommira	this looks like a fun little project, linked on the arch wiki for "locate": https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/03/05/how-the-locate-command-works-and-lets-rewrite-it-in-one-minute/
2020-07-02 18:24:12	ommira	u no it

2020-06-24 21:45:09	zarathustra_69	well, for some reason it finally started working... maybe because i finally closed all instances of qutebrowser... hadn't thought of that
2020-06-24 10:13:41	zzarathustra_69	But it's description says that it enables the websites dark theme, so I figured qute would work the same. But its possible that the qutebrowser way is weaker.

2020-07-06 21:35:19	zarathustra_69	do you guys want to choose some programming examples to go over from the chapter on Thurs?
2020-07-06 21:37:04	zarathustra_69	@ommedulla yes the optimus manager setting... have to use my nvidia for my external monitor bc the hdmi port is hooked to it, which isn't a problem bc i'm always hooked up to power. will be nice to have the auto switch for when running on battery tho
2020-07-06 21:52:54	zarathustra_69	as a matter of fact, i have a small program i am working on that would be great if we could look at. it just checks if the input is a "narcissistic number"
2020-07-06 22:19:07	ommedulla	^^^ sure! I'm planning on working through chapter 1 tonight
2020-07-06 22:19:38	ommedulla	^^great! im in the same boat, need nvidia to use an external monitor (in whch case I'm always plugged in)

2020-07-07 13:32:37	zzarathustra_69	^^ had a crazy dream this morning that i was waiting for my alarm to go off, and as soon as the time changed in my dream my alarm really went off. but according to this article i may have just made up that part of the dream in split seconds after the fact :')
2020-07-07 17:11:56	ommedulla	haha maybe. imo pointing out instances of retroactive "mistakes" about perception is the easy way out of creating an account of perception/conscious experience. E.g., in the flash-lag illusion, you describe the timing of the flash and the other thing as instantaneous or not, in a way that doesn't track or accurately represent the stimuli as they were presented. But why would perception be made of representations of discrete stimuli of the kind that happen to be useful to experimenters? These "mistakes" aren't mistakes if you consider perceptaion as an activity that creates useful "presentations", or creates a useful "perceptul field", based on how it is keyed into events like flashes of light.
2020-07-07 17:12:49	ommedulla	imo there's no reason to suppose that perception does or should be fast representation of events like light flashes. That's not what experience is like (speaker on authority of being someone who experiences), and it would be less useful if it did work like that
2020-07-07 17:15:06	ommedulla	another great example of a retroactive effect like the flash lag is: you're presented with a green dot on the elft side of a screen. quickly, it disappears and a red dot is presented to the right. You would describe your experience as seeing the green dot move from the left to the right, and change color as it goes (and imo, this is what your experience is like, reflected in your decription). You aren't "misrepresenting" the dot as moving, or making a mistake about what is going on (unless your goal is to decribe what is going on in the experimental apparatus). This is just how perception goes when you're in a situation like that.
2020-07-07 17:18:47	ommedulla	to me experiments like that reveal the insight that perception is not a quick copy of events like flashing lights, but constructed on the basis of events that occur at various timepoints (agreeing with the general conclusion of the article). It's just that these experiments don't show that you are constructing a particular representational experience that can be analyzed at any "moment" in the way you can describe the timepoint of a flashof light or movement of a pool ball. Experience doesn't move/change in th way that we impute objects like "light stimuli" to

2020-07-07 21:37:08	zarathustra_69	so how would you relate that to the dream scenario?
2020-07-07 21:38:46	zarathustra_69	i'm guessing the person who posted this article on the reddit thread i found it on (in response to a similar dream scenario where someone felt they predicted their alarm) would claim that i invented the coincidence between my dream clock and real clock in the split second between when i heard my alarm and when i woke up
2020-07-07 21:39:24	zarathustra_69	though i will say that i woke up an hour earlier and went back to sleep because i knew i could sleep in, so i could well have been anticipating it based on my circadian rhythm, which on most days i do wake up a few minutes before my alarm goes off
2020-07-07 21:40:00	zarathustra_69	but in the dream, it felt like i was watching the hand of the clock move to where my alarm was set to go off, and when it lined up, i heard the alarm go off in real life which pulled me out of the dream
2020-07-07 22:11:37	ommedulla	I'd say believe your memory, and that it wouldn't have surprised you if your dream alarm had been at another time. misremembering details of episodic memories probably happens all the time, but if you experienced watching the hand go to a particular spot in your dream, and that's how you remembered it right after, that must be what you experienced! especially with your plausible reasons that your dream planner could have anticipated it
2020-07-07 22:12:44	ommedulla	neuroscientists like to say that everything you think you know about your experience is wrong. well, jokes on them, they are doing science in experience
2020-07-07 22:19:35	ommedulla	your recent memory of your experience is the ground truth about what your experience is. psychology/neuroscience can point out interesting ways that your behavior, and experience, relate to events and to your previous descriptions (and in the case of rememebring things like an eyewitness, there is strong reason to doubt your later descriptions), but psychology and neuroscience depend on trusting descriptions of recent expereince for their explananda. Like you did just now, your description of an interesting experience is the starting point for an interesting line of investigation about how that experience was possible
2020-07-07 22:22:10	ommedulla	but then again, maybe dream experiences are special. they are extra hard to remember etc., and you are definitely in a pretty weird place wehn just waking up. might not be the best situation to found all your beleifs on...
2020-07-08 13:31:13	zzarathustra_69	Hm, so im psychic after all!
2020-07-08 13:32:31	zzarathustra_69	Honestly, it wouldn't be too hard for me to believe that my body just has a pretty good sense of time, since I wake up around the same time every day. That to me is a more straightforward explanation than some crazy paradox about how my perception lags behind in time by 80 milliseconds

2020-06-26 08:24:34	zzarathustra_69	well, I'll be hangin and hackin tonight if anybody wants to
2020-06-24 21:45:09	zarathustra_69	well, for some reason it finally started working... maybe because i finally closed all instances of qutebrowser... hadn't thought of that
2020-06-24 10:13:41	zzarathustra_69	But it's description says that it enables the websites dark theme, so I figured qute would work the same. But its possible that the qutebrowser way is weaker.
2020-06-24 10:12:33	zzarathustra_69	But, it could be that this website doesn't have a true dark mode. The FF/Chrome extension I use, "Dark Reader", just inserts come code when it loads a web page, so it could create the illusion for me that more websites have a dark theme than really do
2020-06-24 10:11:02	zzarathustra_69	Well, on websites like archlinux.org, I am expecting it to enable dark mode so that the website shows a dark color scheme instead of the basic white background
2020-06-24 10:07:34	&ttylta	What are you expecting it to do btw?
2020-06-24 10:07:19	&ttylta	I'll keep trying things on my end and report back
2020-06-24 10:07:11	&ttylta	huh
2020-06-24 10:01:25	zzarathustra_69	Yeah still not working!
2020-06-24 09:53:03	zzarathustra_69	I see, I'll try that. Weird it's not working the other ways, as it's supposed to.
2020-06-24 09:49:02	&ttylta	And yeah, that should go in .config/qutebrowser/config.py
2020-06-24 09:48:52	&ttylta	SWEEEEEEEEET
2020-06-24 09:41:35	zzarathustra_69	I've just been lazy/busy, but its vacation season so things get slow.
2020-06-24 09:41:06	zzarathustra_69	P.S., finally using my linux workstation for werk B-)... it is worth it just to use i3, rather than fumbling around with Windows
2020-06-24 09:39:55	zzarathustra_69	Yes, well, I did it from the command prompt, and also thru the config page. Is that syntax u sent meant to be in a config file tho?
2020-06-24 09:14:14	&ttylta	Did this work for you zarathustra_69: config.set("colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled", True)
2020-06-24 09:06:01	&ttylta	I'll look into it today.
2020-06-23 22:25:42	zarathustra_69	i usually use the "dark reader" browser extension on firefox
2020-06-23 22:25:12	zarathustra_69	I have enabled it via the :set command... doesn't seem to work
2020-06-23 22:24:48	zarathustra_69	anybody know how the FUCk to get qutebrowser dark mode working?

2020-07-08 13:32:31	zzarathustra_69	Honestly, it wouldn't be too hard for me to believe that my body just has a pretty good sense of time, since I wake up around the same time every day. That to me is a more straightforward explanation than some crazy paradox about how my perception lags behind in time by 80 milliseconds
2020-07-08 13:31:13	zzarathustra_69	Hm, so im psychic after all!
2020-07-07 22:22:10	ommedulla	but then again, maybe dream experiences are special. they are extra hard to remember etc., and you are definitely in a pretty weird place wehn just waking up. might not be the best situation to found all your beleifs on...
2020-07-07 22:19:35	ommedulla	your recent memory of your experience is the ground truth about what your experience is. psychology/neuroscience can point out interesting ways that your behavior, and experience, relate to events and to your previous descriptions (and in the case of rememebring things like an eyewitness, there is strong reason to doubt your later descriptions), but psychology and neuroscience depend on trusting descriptions of recent expereince for their explananda. Like you did just now, your description of an interesting experience is the starting point for an interesting line of investigation about how that experience was possible
2020-07-07 22:12:44	ommedulla	neuroscientists like to say that everything you think you know about your experience is wrong. well, jokes on them, they are doing science in experience
2020-07-07 22:11:38	ommedulla	I'd say believe your memory, and that it wouldn't have surprised you if your dream alarm had been at another time. misremembering details of episodic memories probably happens all the time, but if you experienced watching the hand go to a particular spot in your dream, and that's how you remembered it right after, that must be what you experienced! especially with your plausible reasons that your dream planner could have anticipated it
2020-07-07 21:40:00	zarathustra_69	but in the dream, it felt like i was watching the hand of the clock move to where my alarm was set to go off, and when it lined up, i heard the alarm go off in real life which pulled me out of the dream
2020-07-07 21:39:24	zarathustra_69	though i will say that i woke up an hour earlier and went back to sleep because i knew i could sleep in, so i could well have been anticipating it based on my circadian rhythm, which on most days i do wake up a few minutes before my alarm goes off
2020-07-07 21:38:46	zarathustra_69	i'm guessing the person who posted this article on the reddit thread i found it on (in response to a similar dream scenario where someone felt they predicted their alarm) would claim that i invented the coincidence between my dream clock and real clock in the split second between when i heard my alarm and when i woke up
2020-07-07 21:37:08	zarathustra_69	so how would you relate that to the dream scenario?
2020-07-07 18:34:22	ommedulla	shift + i to go to insert at the beginning of a line is another big revelation
2020-07-07 18:33:43	ommedulla	til that you can pres "a" in vim to go to insert mode after the current character (I had always used "i" + "arrow key"...) not sure how I missed this one in the vim tutor, but it's a huge gamechanger
2020-07-07 17:19:16	ommedulla	sorry to take up the whole chat window, obviously have a lot of opinions about this haha
2020-07-07 17:18:47	ommedulla	to me experiments like that reveal the insight that perception is not a quick copy of events like flashing lights, but constructed on the basis of events that occur at various timepoints (agreeing with the general conclusion of the article). It's just that these experiments don't show that you are constructing a particular representational experience that can be analyzed at any "moment" in the way you can describe the timepoint of a flashof light or movement of a pool ball. Experience doesn't move/change in th way that we impute objects like "light stimuli" to
2020-07-07 17:15:06	ommedulla	another great example of a retroactive effect like the flash lag is: you're presented with a green dot on the elft side of a screen. quickly, it disappears and a red dot is presented to the right. You would describe your experience as seeing the green dot move from the left to the right, and change color as it goes (and imo, this is what your experience is like, reflected in your decription). You aren't "misrepresenting" the dot as moving, or making a mistake about what is going on (unless your goal is to decribe what is going on in the experimental apparatus). This is just how perception goes when you're in a situation like that. 
2020-07-07 17:12:49	ommedulla	imo there's no reason to suppose that perception does or should be fast representation of events like light flashes. That's not what experience is like (speaker on authority of being someone who experiences), and it would be less useful if it did work like that
2020-07-07 17:11:56	ommedulla	haha maybe. imo pointing out instances of retroactive "mistakes" about perception is the easy way out of creating an account of perception/conscious experience. E.g., in the flash-lag illusion, you describe the timing of the flash and the other thing as instantaneous or not, in a way that doesn't track or accurately represent the stimuli as they were presented. But why would perception be made of representations of discrete stimuli of the kind that happen to be useful to experimenters? These "mistakes" aren't mistakes if you consider perceptaion as an activity that creates useful "presentations", or creates a useful "perceptul field", based on how it is keyed into events like flashes of light. 
2020-07-07 13:32:37	zzarathustra_69	^^ had a crazy dream this morning that i was waiting for my alarm to go off, and as soon as the time changed in my dream my alarm really went off. but according to this article i may have just made up that part of the dream in split seconds after the fact :')

2020-07-07 21:37:08	zarathustra_69	so how would you relate that to the dream scenario?
2020-07-07 18:34:22	ommedulla	shift + i to go to insert at the beginning of a line is another big revelation
2020-07-07 18:33:43	ommedulla	til that you can pres "a" in vim to go to insert mode after the current character (I had always used "i" + "arrow key"...) not sure how I missed this one in the vim tutor, but it's a huge gamechanger
2020-07-07 17:19:16	ommedulla	sorry to take up the whole chat window, obviously have a lot of opinions about this haha
2020-07-07 17:18:47	ommedulla	to me experiments like that reveal the insight that perception is not a quick copy of events like flashing lights, but constructed on the basis of events that occur at various timepoints (agreeing with the general conclusion of the article). It's just that these experiments don't show that you are constructing a particular representational experience that can be analyzed at any "moment" in the way you can describe the timepoint of a flashof light or movement of a pool ball. Experience doesn't move/change in th way that we impute objects like "light stimuli" to
2020-07-07 17:15:06	ommedulla	another great example of a retroactive effect like the flash lag is: you're presented with a green dot on the elft side of a screen. quickly, it disappears and a red dot is presented to the right. You would describe your experience as seeing the green dot move from the left to the right, and change color as it goes (and imo, this is what your experience is like, reflected in your decription). You aren't "misrepresenting" the dot as moving, or making a mistake about what is going on (unless your goal is to decribe what is going on in the experimental apparatus). This is just how perception goes when you're in a situation like that. 
2020-07-07 17:12:49	ommedulla	imo there's no reason to suppose that perception does or should be fast representation of events like light flashes. That's not what experience is like (speaker on authority of being someone who experiences), and it would be less useful if it did work like that
2020-07-07 17:11:56	ommedulla	haha maybe. imo pointing out instances of retroactive "mistakes" about perception is the easy way out of creating an account of perception/conscious experience. E.g., in the flash-lag illusion, you describe the timing of the flash and the other thing as instantaneous or not, in a way that doesn't track or accurately represent the stimuli as they were presented. But why would perception be made of representations of discrete stimuli of the kind that happen to be useful to experimenters? These "mistakes" aren't mistakes if you consider perceptaion as an activity that creates useful "presentations", or creates a useful "perceptul field", based on how it is keyed into events like flashes of light. 
2020-07-07 13:32:37	zzarathustra_69	^^ had a crazy dream this morning that i was waiting for my alarm to go off, and as soon as the time changed in my dream my alarm really went off. but according to this article i may have just made up that part of the dream in split seconds after the fact :')
2020-07-07 13:31:46	zzarathustra_69	sans the last '\'

2020-07-07 07:31:43	zzarathustra_69	yeah I'll try and finish it today and put it up there. haven't even tried to compile it yet hehe
2020-07-06 22:20:38	ommedulla	!
2020-07-06 22:20:30	ommedulla	^ and sounds great! want to put it on github or similar so we can all preview?
2020-07-06 22:19:38	ommedulla	^^great! im in the same boat, need nvidia to use an external monitor (in whch case I'm always plugged in)
2020-07-06 22:19:07	ommedulla	^^^ sure! I'm planning on working through chapter 1 tonight
2020-07-06 21:52:54	zarathustra_69	as a matter of fact, i have a small program i am working on that would be great if we could look at. it just checks if the input is a "narcissistic number"
2020-07-06 21:37:04	zarathustra_69	@ommedulla yes the optimus manager setting... have to use my nvidia for my external monitor bc the hdmi port is hooked to it, which isn't a problem bc i'm always hooked up to power. will be nice to have the auto switch for when running on battery tho
2020-07-06 21:35:19	zarathustra_69	do you guys want to choose some programming examples to go over from the chapter on Thurs?
2020-07-06 15:43:04	ommedulla	you all might like this weechat plugin: https://github.com/GermainZ/weechat-vimode
2020-07-06 14:46:27	ommedulla	@zz the optimus manager setting? awesome. I wish i'd found it a while ago!
2020-07-06 13:40:39	zzarathustra_69	wow! that's exactly what I need owen lol. timely
2020-07-06 10:17:15	ommedulla	:q
2020-07-06 10:17:09	ommedulla	cool hack for razer keyboard lighting: https://www.reddit.com/r/unixporn/comments/hgba3b/i3_razer_blade_stealth_highlighting_shortcuts_and/

2020-07-05 20:01:12	ommedulla	@ttyelud also, I've been using optimus-manager's "auto" mode and it works pretty nicely. Can set it to boot intel if on battery, and nvidia if plugged in. have you tried it?
2020-07-05 19:28:56	ommedulla	gr8, same here. hows philly?

2020-07-05 15:11:52	&ttylta	It's fun. 
2020-07-05 15:11:51	&ttylta	And I've tried problems on project euler years ago.
2020-07-05 15:11:23	&ttylta	I'm now on forever. 
2020-07-02 18:28:11	@ommira:matrix.org	also, has anyone tried the problems on https://projecteuler.net/? I'm thinking of working through some of them in C as a way to get comfy
2020-07-02 18:25:49	@ommira:matrix.org	this looks like a fun little project, linked on the arch wiki for "locate": https://jvns.ca/blog/2015/03/05/how-the-locate-command-works-and-lets-rewrite-it-in-one-minute/
2020-07-02 18:24:12	@ommira:matrix.org	u no it
2020-06-30 10:59:43	zzarathustra_69	and libreboot
2020-06-30 10:55:50	zzarathustra_69	so 2021 we are all gonna install gentoo right
2020-06-29 22:27:05	zarathustra_69	nobody gets on here :(
2020-06-26 18:17:51	zarathustra_69	jjjjj
2020-06-26 08:24:34	zzarathustra_69	well, I'll be hangin and hackin tonight if anybody wants to
2020-06-24 21:45:09	zarathustra_69	well, for some reason it finally started working... maybe because i finally closed all instances of qutebrowser... hadn't thought of that
2020-06-24 10:13:41	zzarathustra_69	But it's description says that it enables the websites dark theme, so I figured qute would work the same. But its possible that the qutebrowser way is weaker.
2020-06-24 10:12:33	zzarathustra_69	But, it could be that this website doesn't have a true dark mode. The FF/Chrome extension I use, "Dark Reader", just inserts come code when it loads a web page, so it could create the illusion for me that more websites have a dark theme than really do
2020-06-24 10:11:02	zzarathustra_69	Well, on websites like archlinux.org, I am expecting it to enable dark mode so that the website shows a dark color scheme instead of the basic white background
2020-06-24 10:07:34	&ttylta	What are you expecting it to do btw?
2020-06-24 10:07:19	&ttylta	I'll keep trying things on my end and report back
2020-06-24 10:07:11	&ttylta	huh
2020-06-24 10:01:25	zzarathustra_69	Yeah still not working!
2020-06-24 09:53:03	zzarathustra_69	I see, I'll try that. Weird it's not working the other ways, as it's supposed to.
2020-06-24 09:49:02	&ttylta	And yeah, that should go in .config/qutebrowser/config.py
2020-06-24 09:48:52	&ttylta	SWEEEEEEEEET
2020-06-24 09:41:35	zzarathustra_69	I've just been lazy/busy, but its vacation season so things get slow.
2020-06-24 09:41:06	zzarathustra_69	P.S., finally using my linux workstation for werk B-)... it is worth it just to use i3, rather than fumbling around with Windows
2020-06-24 09:39:55	zzarathustra_69	Yes, well, I did it from the command prompt, and also thru the config page. Is that syntax u sent meant to be in a config file tho?
2020-06-24 09:14:14	&ttylta	Did this work for you zarathustra_69: config.set("colors.webpage.darkmode.enabled", True)
2020-06-24 09:06:01	&ttylta	I'll look into it today.
2020-06-23 22:25:42	zarathustra_69	i usually use the "dark reader" browser extension on firefox
2020-06-23 22:25:12	zarathustra_69	I have enabled it via the :set command... doesn't seem to work
2020-06-23 22:24:48	zarathustra_69	anybody know how the FUCk to get qutebrowser dark mode working?
2020-06-23 22:24:05	zarathustra_69	fyckerz!!
2020-06-23 22:23:48	zarathustra_69	ok finally on this shit

2020-06-18 18:43:34	zzarathustra_69	some day covid will not prevent us from travel and we can get together for a weekend and eat pizza and drink soda pop!
2020-06-18 18:42:13	zzarathustra_69	pre-covid i was hoping to come up to bmore to do so in person, and now y'all are movin away! but we can always do it virtual.
2020-06-18 18:41:29	zzarathustra_69	that'd be down the line tho when we are comfortable with the syntax and stuff... but would be cool to do from time to time if we want a little boost, only so much we will ever get done together in a few hours a week
2020-06-18 18:40:24	zzarathustra_69	I'd also be into, once we get working on a project down the line, doing something like a whole-day ojjo marathon where we do a bunch of work
2020-06-18 18:39:46	zzarathustra_69	but I was thinking we could look at 'c programming language' and talk about a general plan or way of going about working thru it
2020-06-18 18:39:02	zzarathustra_69	im still doin some ricing stuff, really just need to get the terminal font bigger and I cant remember how I did that on this one
2020-06-18 18:38:18	zzarathustra_69	gotta set it up on my thinkpad tho
2020-06-18 18:37:23	zzarathustra_69	yeeet i do still use it this is way better than slack LOL
2020-06-18 18:11:33	ommedulla	Ill be down2clown around 7:30 or 8 tonight
2020-06-18 18:11:08	ommedulla	&zz looking at c programming language tn sounds good to me! @tt thanks for the fonts. just using this on my thinkpad, but meaning to set it up on daily razer too.
2020-06-16 19:04:52	&ttylta	Anyway, I'm on here everyday. Gonna start posting links to shit. Trying this out soon: https://github.com/iberianpig/fusuma
2020-06-16 19:04:28	&ttylta	You guys still using this thing!?
2020-06-14 11:38:04	&ttylta	invite @neonone:matrix.org
2020-06-13 16:39:44	zzarathustra_69	Maybe on thursday we can check out the C programming language, and figure out a loose timeline for how we wanna work thru it
2020-06-13 16:39:06	zzarathustra_69	Syck that would be fun.
2020-06-12 22:02:48	&ttylta	Turns out the API for matrix is pretty straightforward. I really think we could make a client in C. 
2020-06-12 16:41:35	&ttylta	I'm using curie on the new machine, cozette on the old.
2020-06-12 16:41:22	&ttylta	Oh, and ommedulla: best bitmap fonts are curie, tamyzyn, cozette, and terminus.
2020-06-12 15:14:58	&ttylta	But that's only for scrolling in the current message list

2020-06-12 14:52:30	&ttylta	Here's a list of common keybindings and how to change them: https://weechat.org/files/doc/stable/weechat_quickstart.en.html#key_bindings
2020-06-12 14:48:49	&ttylta	You can also type in /window page_up
2020-06-12 14:46:56	&ttylta	You can change that with /set
2020-06-12 14:46:41	&ttylta	Sorry, page up.
2020-06-12 14:46:30	&ttylta	Yeah, the default binding is page down.
2020-06-12 11:49:50	ommedulla	also, do you know how to scroll back in history in weechat?

2020-07-10 20:53:02	ommedulla	started the euler problems last night and thought it was a great exercise to try how to do some of them in c. The first two problems on the site were similar kinds of problems to Max's program. Especially the 2nd problem I felt like I learned a lot about how to approach things in c, and what kind of algorithms (I think that's the right word) can make the problem possible to solve efficiently (e.g., by not needing huge arrays). If you all are interested it would be great to compare notes/approaches!
2020-07-10 20:55:46	ommedulla	heres my solution to problem 2. It seemed like a fraily commonsensical approach to me, but based on other answers on the site there are much cleaner ways to do it (fewer lines, making fewer objects). working on coming up with a more concise solution in c

2020-07-11 14:13:44	zarathustra_69	I like the concept of function declaration. lately i've been thinking about how this mirrors the way we learn, or at least a nice trick I have found for learning: take in a broad overview of a topic first, i.e. read the first time once thru without stopping, skim, whatever to get the gist ane 'make space" for information, then go through a second or even third time in finer detail when you already have some understanding of what you are learning at least in the form of some general schema and how it fits into the broader topic in a general way
2020-07-11 14:39:39	zzarathustra_69	Also, if you guys wanted to study some  compsci stuff later when we get a handle on C, specifically discrete math & algorithms, i found some good textbooks online and put them here https://drive.google.com/file/d/1gw5A1yfzEVoDBSHhkTx97BJ6jB5-LiEV/view?usp=sharing

2020-07-11 16:52:17	ommedulla	I came across it as one of a few references in the Linux Kernel's style guide, which I was looking at because the just approved a pull request to update blacklist/whitelist, master/slave naming

2020-07-11 23:58:37	ommedulla	looking at your gist, your solution makes sense. (I am understanding the idea as declaring the length of the array as a constant, as well as the contents of the array. I still think it would be nice/more elegant if there were a way to link the array contents and size. For example, if you had an array of many letters, or were reading the letters from a file, you might want the length to be determined based on the content that is fed in. (it seems to me that it could be error prone to have to enter the length, and contents, of a long array manually).

2020-07-18 19:41:03	ommedulla	the only thing is orm is very sick! in the cat ICU. we think he was exposed to some tylenol during the move (apparently, even a little residue can be really bad/deadly for a cat). he seems to be doing better today but he will need to stay there for a little bit, and I might need to pick him up any time soon.

2020-07-18 19:39:05	ommedulla	@zzarathustra_69 nice, thanks for having a go at the hist script. I'll look in more detail when more things are unpacked (just set up the b4tt13st4ti0n). if we get a lot done tomorrow during the day, I should be free sunday evening too

2020-07-20 12:21:36	zarathustra_69	I'm going away for a week first week of august, but do you guys think we could probably start on a project by the time i get back? I think so. We should think about what we want to do.
2020-07-20 12:22:13	zarathustra_69	Unless you guys think we should really focus onworking thru the book, rather than finish it simultaneously

2020-07-20 17:12:34	ommedulla	Orm is okay and back home! he'll need one more bloodtest to confirm, but he seems to have made a full recovery. The move went great otherwise, and I set up a nice big desk for work/h4xing. Still got some unpacking to do, but should be able to work through the book some this week and will definitely be free thursday. I'd prefer to take it slow with the c book, but if someone has a fun idea for a project I'll be happy to dive in
